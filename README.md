# Single-Cell Mitochondrial Mutational burden analysis

*Yu-Hsin Hsieh*

This repository contains code needed to reproduce analyses and figures for the following work:

*Hsieh et al., Single-cell multi-omics resolved analysis of mitochondrial genome-wide mutational burden, constraint, and mosaicism*

- The `POLG_HEK` folder contains code for generating Figures 1-4 and Extended Data Figures 1-5.

- The `PBMC` folder contains code for generating Figures 5-6 and Extended Data Figures 6-8.

Due to GitHub's file size limitations, large data files (>100MB) are available from the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/7kj2p/?view_only=fc0597b2d2e246db830da3b8e8f91769). Two zip archives are available: `POLG_HEK_large_data_files.zip` and `PBMC_large_data_files.zip`. After decompressing, locate the folder corresponding to the appropriate folder in the repository.
